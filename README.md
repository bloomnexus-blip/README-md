> "With ethics we sow, through empathy we grow."

This is the official research and development repository for the **Flower Model**, a novel cognitive architecture for artificial intelligence designed for inherent ethical governance and sophisticated empathetic response.

## üéØ Project Mission

Our mission is to develop an open, auditable, and safe alternative to "black-box" AI systems. We believe the future of AI depends not on raw intellect, but on its capacity for contextual understanding and empathetic interaction. The Flower Model is our proposed solution to achieve this, grounding AI development in the principles of **Care, Continuity, and Justice.**

## üìú Core Research: The Foundational White Paper

The foundational principles and architecture of this project are detailed in our official White Paper. This document outlines the theoretical framework, the core methodology of the Valence Token System, and the initial simulation results that validate the system's security.

## üíª Current Focus: The Context Engine (Prototype v1.0)

We are currently developing a functional prototype of the **Valence Token System**, the core memory component of the Flower Model.

*   **Objective:** To build and validate a system that can encode events into a 3D space of Arousal, Valence, and Impact Scope, storing critical events in a tamper-evident ledger.
*   **Technology:** Python 3
*   **Status:** Initial simulations are successful. The core `InteractionPoint` and `ValenceLedger` classes are functional and have passed integrity checks.

The code for this prototype can be found in the `simulation_v1.py` file in this repository.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

This is currently a closed research project. However, we are actively seeking collaboration with academic institutions and are in the process of onboarding our first research interns. If you are a researcher in AI ethics, affective computing, or cognitive science and are interested in our work, please feel free to reach out through our official project channels (to be announced).
